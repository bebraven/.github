# Braven 
> Empowering the next generation of leaders

## We’re on a mission
Braven's mission is to empower promising, underrepresented young people—first-generation college students, students from low-income backgrounds, and/or students of color—with the skills, confidence, experiences, and networks necessary to transition from college to strong first jobs, which lead to meaningful careers and lives of impact.
